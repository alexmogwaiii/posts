1. Implemented Users page, which shows a table with all users from JSON placeholder api.

2. Implemented Post page with all detail of current post, an added block of comments, and two-button. The first button Delete makes a request to API and deletes a current post by ID. The second button Edit allows edit the field title and body of the current post, then push data to API using PUT method.
